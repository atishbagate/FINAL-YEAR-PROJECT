# Brain Age Prediction
## Prediction of Brain Age.
Using google colab.


* This Project aims to predict the brain tissue age of a person using his/her MRI scan.
* We implemented a 3D convolutional Neural Network in Keras which was trained over T1 weighted MRI scan of around 1500 healthy person.
* The difference of brain age and chronological can be used to detect the presence of a mental disorder if there is any such deformity.

## Installation

* Numpy
* Pandas
* matplotlib.pylab
* seaborn
* Scipy
